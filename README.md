ðŸ“„ Project Documentation
ðŸ§  Objective
Build a machine learning system to predict e-commerce delivery time using order, agent, and external condition features.
ðŸ“¦ Dataset
Contains order IDs, location coordinates, agent info, order/pickup time, weather, traffic, and actual delivery duration.
ðŸ›  Steps Covered
1.	Data Preprocessing
a.	Missing value handling, datetime parsing, category encoding
2.	Feature Engineering
a.	Distance calculation (Haversine/Geodesic)
b.	Time features: hour, weekday, pickup delay
3.	EDA
a.	Understand impact of weather, traffic, agent, and time
4.	Model Training
a.	Models used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
b.	Evaluated using RMSE, MAE, RÂ²
c.	Logged via MLflow
5.	Deployment
a.	Streamlit app for real-time prediction
b.	Accepts all relevant input fields
ðŸ”§ Tools Used
â€¢	Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
â€¢	Matplotlib, Seaborn
â€¢	MLflow for model tracking
â€¢	Streamlit for deployment
ðŸ“Š Results
â€¢	Gradient Boosting performed best with lowest RMSE
â€¢	Insights into how weather and traffic significantly affect delivery time
